# RL-classic_gym_environments

This is the repo for the Reinforcement Learning for Classic Gymnasium Environments Taxi and Cart Pole by Jay Mehta.
\\
This repo contains the Q-Learning algorithm code for Cart Pole and Temporal Difference(0) Learning and Monte Carlo Algorithm codes for Taxi
\\
Results for Taxi:-\\
Monte Carlo - Model learns very barely and the improvement by increasing training isn't much.\\
TD(0) - Gives an average reward over 1000 episodes, more than 8 which is pretty close to the optimal value\\
Results for Cart Pole:-\\
Q-Learning - Model performs very good on sufficient training time, giving an average reward of 3000 in the final 1000 episodes of training which is pretty high considering the fact that the problem is considered solved if the average rewards exceeds 200.
